Printer ePos without IoT in HTTPS
=================================

With the restrictions of the various browsers (Chrome, Edge), 
it is essential to communicate with ePos printers using HTTPS.

.. note::
   *ePos Printer* is a printer that can work without IoT Box 
   (the POS sends the tickets to be printed directly to the printer).

Generate a Self-Signed certififcate
===================================

Go to ip address of your ePos printer: `http://printer-ip`

.. note::
   The IP address is automatically printed by the printer during startup

.. important::
   It is strongly recommended to assign a fixed IP address to the printer from the network router

go to :menuselection:`Authentication --> Certificate List`, then create a new Self-Signed Certificate

- **Common Name**: `IP address of the ePos Printer`
- **Validity Period**: `10`

Create and reboot the printer

After reboot go to :menuselection:`Security --> SSL/TLS`, then check if 'Selfsigned Certificate' is
 selected

Export this Self-Signed certififcate
====================================

When your printer is rebooted go to the ip address through https: `https://printer-ip`
You need to accept the self signed certificate.
So as not to have to accept it several times we will import it into Chrome

Click on :menuselection:`Not secure --> Certificate is not valid`.
